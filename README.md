PeacePoints are being kept as a variable inside of the flowchart object in the Dialogue scene
and can be accessed through passing the flowchart object into a script as shown in the UpdatePeacePoints script.

The Superhero script is the result of the beginnings of a shop like system that was planned to use ScriptableObjects.
Nothing relies on the Superhero script as of now.
